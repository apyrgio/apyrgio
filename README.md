### Sup üëã

I'm Alex, a software engineer, working on various open source projects.
Currently, I'm a maintainer of [Dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks/), a
multi-platform tool that helps people open untrusted documents and share them
safely.

My interests tend to gravitate towards systems programming, but I've found
myself working all over the stack; Kubernetes, Django, storage systems,
peer-to-peer protocols, GUIs, etc. I also maintain some personal projects in
Rust ü¶Ä and Python üêç.

### Sup ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a software engineer, working on various open source projects. My
interests tend to gravitate towards systems and security engineering, but I've
also dipped my toes in Kubernetes, Django, storage systems, and peer-to-peer
protocols.

Currently, I'm aiding in the development of
[Dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks/), a multi-platform tool for document
sanitization. You can also check out some of my security projects in Rust
:crab:. If you do use them or you're interested in them, feel free to [drop me a
line](mailto:apyrgio@gmail.com).

### Sup ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a software engineer at [Arrikto](https://www.arrikto.com/). We work at
the intersection of Kubernetes, ML, storage and P2P systems. It's fun, come
[join us](https://apply.workable.com/arrikto/) if you're interested.

I also maintain some FOSS security (:crossed_fingers:) projects in Rust
:crab:. If you do use them or you're interested in them, feel free to [contact
me](mailto:apyrgio@gmail.com).

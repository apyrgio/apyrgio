### Sup ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a software engineer, nowadays working on various open source projects.
Previously, I worked with the awesome folks at
[Arrikto](https://www.arrikto.com/), doing all sorts of Kubernetes, storage and
P2P stuff.

You can also check out some of my security projects in Rust :crab:. If you do
use them or you're interested in them, feel free to [drop me a
line](mailto:apyrgio@gmail.com).
